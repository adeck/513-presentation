# Inapproximability of Nondeterministic State and Transition Complexity Assuming P \ne NP

## personal observations

- themes
  - a bunch of different applications for finite automata which involve
    potentially enormous data footprints
    - circuit design, natural language processing, computational biology,
      parallel processing, image compression, etc.

## 1. Introduction

* jesus christ- did no one take any tech writing courses?
  * Introduction -- the name you give a section if you want to guarantee only
    the most assiduous readers won't skip it

- general comments & previous research
  - many applications for finite automata
  - known that NFAs and DFAs are equal in expressive power
    - however, NFAs can be "exponentially more succinct"
  - under cryptographic assumptions, it's been proven that you can't approximate
    within \frac{\sqrt{n}}{polylog(n)} for state minimization, and
    \frac{n}{polylog(n)} for transition minimization
  - however, they were curious about what could be proven with:
    - the weaker, usual assumption of P \ne NP, and
    - a language given as a truth table rather than a DFA
