# What is state complexity?
### (within this presentation)

<blockquote>
&ldquo;For a regular language L, the... state complexity of L... is the minimal
number of states needed by a... finite automaton accepting L.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<!--
- The worst-case growth function
- Associated with a given finite automata / regular language
- Satisfying a set of constraints.
