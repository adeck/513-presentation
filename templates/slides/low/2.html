# Theorem 9

<blockquote>
There is a sequence of languages
$ (L\_n)\_{n \ge 1} $
over a one letter
alphabet such that 
$ nsc(L\_n) = \Omega \left( d\_n^{-\frac{1}{2} } 2^{d\_n} \right) $
where
$d\_n$
is the bipartite dimension of $G_{L_n}$.
</blockquote>

(where $G_{L_n}$ is a bipartitie graph called the "dependency graph" of L, defined in the paper)
