# Theorem 3

<blockquote>
Let $L \subseteq \Sigma^\*$ be a regular language and suppose there
exists a bipartite graph $G = (X, Y, E_L)$ with $X, Y \subseteq
\Sigma^\*$ (not necessarily finite) for the language L. Then any NFA
accepting L has at least as many states as the bipartite dimension
of G, i.e., nsc(L) â‰¥ d(G).
